## How it Works ?
This software leverages advanced image processing algorithms and techniques to perform a variety of tasks on digital images. Here's a general overview of how it works:
1. **Image Input**: Users can import images into the software from various sources, including local files, external devices, or directly from digital cameras or scanners.
2. **Image Processing Pipeline**: Once an image is imported, it undergoes a series of processing steps within the software's pipeline. These steps may include:
   - **Decoding**: The software decodes the image file format to extract its raw pixel data.
   - **Preprocessing**: Basic adjustments may be applied to the image, such as resizing, cropping, or rotating, depending on user preferences or presets.
   - **Enhancement**: Advanced algorithms are employed to enhance the image quality, correct color balance, adjust exposure, reduce noise, and sharpen details.
   - **Filtering and Effects**: Users can apply various filters and effects to the image to achieve artistic or stylistic effects. This may include blurring, sharpening, distortion, or creative effects like sepia tones or vintage looks.
   - **Editing Tools**: Users have access to a wide range of editing tools for precise adjustments, such as levels, curves, gradients, brushes, and cloning tools.
3. **User Interaction**: Throughout the process, users interact with the software through a graphical user interface (GUI). They can make adjustments using sliders, input fields, selection tools, and other interface elements to control the image processing parameters.
4. **Real-Time Preview**: As users make adjustments, they can preview the changes in real-time to see how they affect the image. This helps users fine-tune their edits and achieve their desired results efficiently.
5. **Output**: Once editing is complete, users can save the processed image in various file formats and resolutions, depending on their intended use. They can also export images for print, web, or other digital media platforms.
Overall, the software combines sophisticated algorithms with intuitive user interfaces to empower users to edit and manipulate digital images with precision and creativity. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to cater to the needs of professionals and enthusiasts alike, making it a versatile solution for image editing tasks.

## Libraries used:

2. NumPy
3. PIL / Pillow
4. scikit-image
5. matplotlib
6. TensorFlow
7. PyTorch

## How to Run
To run this code, you need to execute it within a Python environment where the necessary libraries are installed. Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. The code requires `tkinter`, `PIL`, and possibly other libraries like `imghdr`. 
2. **Copy and Paste the Code**: Copy the entire code you provided into a Python script file (e.g., `image_editor.py`).
3. **Run the Script**: You can run the script from your terminal or command prompt by navigating to the directory containing the script.
4. **Interact with the GUI**: Once the script is running, a GUI window should appear with various image editing options. You can interact with the GUI by clicking buttons and using the menus to perform different operations like cropping, rotating, adjusting brightness, applying filters, and more.
5. **Load an Image**: Use the "New" option from the "File" menu to load an image from your computer. Once an image is loaded, you can start applying edits and filters.
6. **Save Your Work**: You can save the edited image using the "Save" or "Save As" options from the "File" menu.
7. **Close the Application**: When you're done editing, you can close the application window.
Make sure you have appropriate permissions to read and write files in the directory where you run the script, especially if you're using the "Save" or "Save As" options.
